    <h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>I was born and raised in Anaheim, CA and moved to Utah back in 2018.
California was too crowded and way too expensive so I felt moving to
Utah was the right move. Although Utah's weather is completely different
than California's weather, I definitely prefer Utah over California. 
Aside from the weather and the amount of people California has, jobs out 
here are a lot better as well. I am currently an Onsite Manager for a Staffing 
Agency that I've been with since I moved out here. I've been in the staffing 
industry for 4 years ao I figured staying in the industry was the smart decision. 
However, as much as I enjoy giving people jobs, I felt I needed to start doing 
something I actually enjoy doing like coding. With that being said, listed below 
are things I enjoy doing as well aside from coding.</pre>
     <h3>Gaming</h3>
         <p>I enjoy playing on the PC as well as on the phone.<br/>
            Action games are usually what I prefer playing.</p>
     <h3>Reading</h3>
         <p>I enjoy reading, however, I prefer reading hard copy books,<br/>
            maingly because using a &lt;EPUB&gt; type books distract me.</p>
     <h3>Hiking</h3>
     <p>I enjoy the outdoors quite a bit as well because it is a perfect way to <br/>
        disconnect from social media. Honestly, I don't do it as much as I <br/> 
        should but when I do, I defintely make it worth it.</p>
